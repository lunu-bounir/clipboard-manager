# Clipboard History Manager

A powerful clipboard manager with a searchable database that can store hundreds of items without any performance drawbacks. This extension has a very simple native component written in c++ that monitors clipboard changes system-wide and notifies the extension about the changes. This way first the extension can monitor clipboard without polling (continuous check with fixed interval) and second it can get notified even if clipboard content is changed by a process out of your browser environment.
